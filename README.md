# DCSDK

This was a project that myself and a few others about ten years ago started.  The goal was to build a cross platform / cross API highly extendable game engine that could be used on any operating system with either DirectX or OpenGL.

The project eventually faded, after several years of working together. The majority of the original code was written by Matthias Kesternich (aka Nitrogenycs), with a few modules written by myself, Chris (aka Treething) Eddie Bouchard (aka Lion) with a little help by Niklaus Myrberg (aka Myran).

In 2016, after many years of silence I gained in interest in Linux and OpenGL programming, and decided to attempt to revive the project, for specific use on Linux with modern OpenGL rendering techniques. I guess nostalgia go to me :).

This software and all the libraries contained are distributed under the GNU General Public Licens, as follows.

I hope all that come here enjoy the hard work from many years ago, and if you have anything to add, or discuss, feel free to email me anytime.

Matthew Ostlund (aka RhoneRanger)
